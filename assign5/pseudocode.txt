<~~Proposal~~>

I found this idea for a program from (user: ultifinitus) at (http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/53812/)

I'm going to create a journal that automatically enters the date and time of the entry followed by the entry. To access the journals you will need to enter a username and password.
The username will point to a text file and the password will grant access to this file.  If the file doesn't exist it will say it doesn't and ask about creating a new one.
The user will also be able to type in a specific date and it will bring up all entrys from that date.

<~~End Proposal~~>


<~~Pseudocode~~>

#include libraries:
iostream
string
fstream
iomanip

include files:
assign4class.cpp

using namespace standard

main
{

while(username != "Exit" or "exit") //If user enters exit the program ends
{
  string username //Variable for entered username
  string password //Variable for entered password
  
  print Enter username:
  userEntry username //User enters desired username
  
  check for file //Uses username variable to access file with the same name
  
  if(file exists) //Uses is_open() function to check if file is open (and thus exists)
  {
    print Enter password:
    userEntry password //User enters password for selected username
    
    check if password is correct //Password will be stored either in a password database file or the journal file
    
    if(password is correct) //Checks variable password against the file's password entry
    {
      open journal file
      ask user if they would like to access old journals or create a new one
      
      if(create new one)
      {
        while(userEnteredLine != "Exit" or "exit") //The user is allowed to write lines in the journal until they type exit on a new line and hit enter
        {
          access current date and time and assign to variables
          print This journal entry will be set for (Current date and time)
          print Insert the entry below.  When finished hit enter and type "Exit":
          userEntry output to file until exit is entered
        }
      }
      else if(access old journals)
      {
        print Please type the date and all journals from that date will be displayed. (Use format MM/DD/YYYY)
        
        accepts user entry of a date.
        
        Searches for identifier with date
        if(entry's exist)
        {
        prints all journal entrys containing this identifier-date combination.  //Only prints the body, disincluding any data (password, username, comments)
        }
        else
        {
        print No journal entry from such date exists
        }
      }
      else
      {
        print Incorrect Entry. Try again.
      }
    }
    else
    {
      print Password Incorrect. Try again.
    }
  }
  else if(username == "new" or "New")
  {
    create new file for username
  }
  else if(username == "Exit" or "exit")
  {
  
  }
  else
  {
    print Doesn't look like there is a journal for this username.
    print If you think there is one carefully retype username.
    print If you would like to create a new journal type "New".
  }
}
}
