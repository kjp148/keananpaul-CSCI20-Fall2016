I found this idea for a program from (user: ultifinitus) at (http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/53812/)

I'm going to create a journal that automatically enters the date and time of the entry followed by the entry.  To access the journals you will need to enter a username and password.
The username will point to a text file and the password will grant access to this file.  If the file doesn't exist it will say it doesn't and ask about creating a new one.

Pseudocode:

include libraries:
iostream
string
fstream
iomanip

include files:
assign4class.cpp

using namespace standard

main
{

  string username
  string password
  
  print Enter username:
  userEntry username
  
  check for file
  
  if(file exists)
  {
    print Enter password:
    userEntry password
    
    check if password is correct
    
    if(password is correct)
    {
      open journal file
      ask user if they would like to access old journals or create a new one
      
      if(create new one)
      {
        while(userEnteredLine != "Exit" or "exit")
        {
          access current date and time and assign to variables
          print This journal entry will be set for (Current date and time)
          print Insert the entry below.  When finished hit enter and type "Exit":
          userEntry output to file until exit is entered
        }
      }
      else if(access old journals)
      {
        print journal file
      }
      else
      {
        print Incorrect Entry. Try again.
      }
    }
    else
    {
      print Password Incorrect. Try again.
    }
  }
  else if(username == "new" or "New")
  {
    create new file for username
  }
  else
  {
    print Doesn't look like there is a journal for this username.
    print If you think there is one carefully retype username.
    print If you would like to create a new journal type "New".
  }
  
}
